Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was created to serve as a weight-tracking tool featuring a minimum of three screens: Login, Daily Weight View, and Daily Weight Entry. It caters to users aiming to establish and pursue their individual weight goals. Although the app's design is finalized, I unfortunately ran short on time to complete the development. Nevertheless, the design and the App Release Plan are robust and well-defined.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

In order to cater to user requirements, I crafted three primary screens for interaction within this application. These screens encompassed the login interface, the daily weight display screen, and the weight entry screen. The login screen provided users with the option to either log in to an existing account or create a new one. The Daily Weight screen exhibited a grid showcasing each daily weight entry made by the user. Meanwhile, the Weight Entry screen featured a straightforward input box and a save button, facilitating users in editing or inputting new weight entries. The application's simplistic design and minimal interactive elements contribute to its user-friendly nature.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

During the coding phase of my app, I heavily leaned on the knowledge and skills acquired from the ZyBooks material in the course and YouTube. This resource provided comprehensive guidance on utilizing Android Studio, covering tasks such as creating accessible buttons, establishing a database, and navigating between screens within the app. I'm a visual learner so seeing it in action also helped. The proficiency gained through these lessons equips me to confidently apply these skills to any future Android Studio projects I may undertake.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

In validating the code I authored, I employed the Android Studio debugger to ensure the proper behavior of each function. It is crucial to thoroughly test every aspect of your application to guarantee its safety and security for users.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The whole project I had to employ a fair amount of creativity when utilizing the Android Studio layout editor to design each layout for my application. The practical application of the editor differs significantly from simply studying the components and understanding their interrelations.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I consider myself successful in formulating a well-structured release plan for my application. I believe that my previous work experience equipped me with the necessary skills in this domain, enabling me to establish effective and achievable goals for the potential monetization and release of my app.
